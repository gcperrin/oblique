# Oblique
### A fast circular buffer.

* A simple circular (or ring) buffer implementation, designed
for speed and size constrained applications (think embedded systems).
Uses power-of-two sizing to achieve higher speeds

## Installation
Source and header files are included for direct integration to your project

## Usage
The header file provides all usage details. Docs will be generated and included
in a future release.

## Contributing
The only notable improvement, besides documentation, would be to replace array-buffered
for loops with direct access memory copies. This will be included in V2.
